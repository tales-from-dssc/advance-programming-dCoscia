## Class Date
Implementation of a class `Date`. This class meets the following requirements:
- it has three **private** attributes to represent day, month and year
- use a scoped enum for month
- it has the following **public** functions:
	- constructor that takes as arguments a day, a month and a year. (Forget about the validation for now)
	- `day()` function that returns the day
	- `month()` function that returns the month
	- `year()` function that returns the year
	- `add_days(const unsigned int n)` which adds `n` days. 
*Notes*:
- Leap years are taken into account
